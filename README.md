# pyMoistureAlarm

A simple pair of Python programs to monitor moisture & alert when a target threshold is exceeded.

## Overview

One program _sensor_ is run from a networked embedded device with moisture sensor.

The other program (_server_) is run on a networked computer with audio output, to alert the room's occupants when the moisture threshold has been exceeded.
